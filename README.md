# _Twig/Silex Template Script_

##### _Create template folders and files for basic Silex apps_

#### By _**Chris Lytsell**_

## Description

This script will create the folders 'app', 'src', 'tests', 'views', and 'web' in 'file_folder' folder.
_Files created are app/app.php, src/Class.php, tests/ClassTest.php, views/home.html.twig, and web/index.php.
Files created include the basic shell of code that is usually always included.

I know this is an archaic type of script, but I mainly just wanted to see if I could get it to work.

## Setup

* I'm brand new to scripting, so you may know more about how to run this script than I do, but this should work:
* Save "test_script.sh" to whatever folder you want to save it in.
* Navigate to this location in your terminal shell
* Type the file name in the command line
* Press enter
* Pray
* Check the location where you saved the "test_script.sh" file, there should be a folder called "file_folder"
* Open the "file_folder" and enjoy
* DISCLAIMER= I am not sure of the portability of this script. I believe if you type sh and the the file name in the terminal it will run on a Mac. 

## Technologies Used

Git Bash for Windows, VIM
